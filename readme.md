## This is a typing speed test

The time starts when the user starts writing and stops when the user enter the correct answer.

There is some feedback if the user is typing the sentence correctly or not:
  - blue if everything is going well
  - red if something is wrong
  - green when all the sentence is correct

The number of errors is counted and presented to the user

The user can swipe between a number of pre-defined sentences.
